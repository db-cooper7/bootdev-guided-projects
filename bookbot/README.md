# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
It's a python program that analyzes text files and generates a statistical report about word and character usage.

## Features:

- It counts the character frequency;
- Counts the number of words in a text file;
- Generates a summary report of the analyzed text;
- Sorts and displays character counts in a readable format.
